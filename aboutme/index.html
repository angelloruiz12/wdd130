    <p>Hello, this is Angello. I would like to follow a career in technology. Particularly, the branch of date base.

        Currently, I have a wonderful family with my wife and my child. We live in a comfortable and cozy small apartment.
        I have already finish a career in administration at Lima University in Peru. This was an amazing experience and I love studying again because I really like technology and it is very interesting for me.

        I like to learn languages. I can speak Spanish as my mother language, English and a little bit of guarani because I served my mission in Paraguay. Now, I have the goal to learn French because I take into consideration traveling to Canada in the future.
