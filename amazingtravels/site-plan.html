      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my site because they are looking for a turism day in some cities in Peru. The visitors
        expect to have information about the different places that they can visit, the culture of these places, and 
        the plan they are going to take.

        They can visite the city of Ica, Lunahuana or other cities. For example, the website will the distant between
        Lima and the city, how many time is the journey, some secundary places to go while we are going to the principal
        attraction, what food or traditions are good, the history about the city and the turism places.

        About the culture we can mention what is the typical food, folk dances and traditions of the cities. The website 
        can help the customer to be interested. 

        The website will show up the plan and what the visitors will do in each place. I can add different options to make 
        the customer decide for example what kind of food they want to eat, the aproximated time they are going to take 
        for each attraction and the final hour when they will arrive to their apartments or rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The home page will have contact information to let the visitors reach us out, for example: phone number,
        social medias like facebook, twitter, and instagram. It also have a link to go to the personal what's app. All these
        link will redirect to the visitor to a new tab. The contact information will be at the footer of the website and it
        will be the same for the 3 pages that I will create. I will provide a number in Spanish and another one in English for 
        foreigners. 
      </p>
      <p>
        People will visit to our website because it will show up the necessary information and it is an easy-to-read 
        web. It is attractive with a lot of pictures and story about the culture and cities to engage the visitors and 
        make them want to have the experience with us. The design will be similar to the logo with colors like green,
        black, dark blue, and gray.

      </ul>
      <h3>Promociones</h3>
      <p>
        Visitors will enter to the promociones page because they want to know what offers the company is giving 
        at the moment. They are going to find different prices and oportunities to live in this section. They are going
        to find a plan of the promotion and some terms and conditions. The promotions will be updated every month and 
        the footer with the contact information will be at this page in case the visitors get some questions. This section 
        will have an input part to let the customer add their e-mail address to send information through the email. 
        The promotion will clearly illustrate the discount in prices or the advantages the visitors can have if they prefer
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visitor will be informed about some advice they can follow to enjoy the most the trip. There will be a list 
        of items they can bring. And they will find information about some cares to prevent Covid 19. This same suggestion 
        section will be in the description of each place on the home page
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        Here, the visitors will find the currently information about new attractions or different activities they 
        can enjoy. That section is important because in different parts of the year there are different festivals that 
        villagers celebrate. Visitors must be informed about these festivals to help them decide to take the trip during that
        time or not. The blog will allow old customers to share some pictures or opinions about the service to have a 
        mini comunity where customers can exchange information and experiences about our service.
