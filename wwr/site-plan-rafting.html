    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to increase the revenues for my new business. It is a 
        new business, so it has another purpose and it is to become known by a lot of people.
        That's why it is an informative website as well. It should be attractive, easy, and encouraging for 
        all people.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation (age, financial situation, interests, and so on)
        What do they want?
        - My target customer is a person (man or woman) who likes to travel around the world and has a remoto work. My
        customer is from different countries and they have a good financial condition, their age range is between 23 to 
        60 years old and they want to know about the culture and customs of Peru, in particular, the city of Ica. My younger
        customers want to do some extreme sports and the older customers want to know very well interesting facts about the 
        city and eat in good restaurants. Both are interested in the comfort and safety of the travel. They want a person who
        can lead them along the travel.

        What are their needs that aren't being met?
        The customers in this industry don't have a huge catalog of all the things or places they can go to 
        get food, buy souvenirs, or to have some adventures.

        How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)?
        My audience usually access my site using mobile phone or laptop.</p>
